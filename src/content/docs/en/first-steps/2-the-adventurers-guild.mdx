Good morning, welcome to Newlia, where new heroes are born!

Are you here to register as an adventurer? And you want to choose the "Programmer" class?  
Great choice! Programmers are a versatile class, give them enough time and they can do anything!

This class requires a small test, to make sure you have the minimum problem-solving skills.  
It'll take just a moment.

Please, fill in the blanks in the following statements, replacing **`?`** with the correct answer.

:::note[Don't worry]
If you mess up the code, click the "Reset" button to return it to its original state.
:::

<SimpleQuestion
  question="What's five plus five?"
  code="5 + 5 == ?"
  answer="10"
  correct="5 + 5 == 10, good job!"
  wrong="5 + 5 != {a}, keep trying!"
/>

Well done! Let's continue.

<SimpleQuestion
  question="What's negative one minus one?"
  code="-1 - 1 == ?"
  answer="-2"
  correct="That's right, -2! I see you aren't fooled easily."
  wrong="-1 - 1 != {a}, keep trying!"
/>

All right, let's up the challenge a bit.

<SimpleQuestion
  question="What's the number that multiplied by two equals sixteen divided by four?"
  code="16 / 4 == 2 * ?"
  answer="2"
  correct="Perfect! Now you know how to make the computer do basic calculations for you, well done!"
  wrong="16 / 4 != 2 * {a}, keep trying!"
/>

Well, well, Mr. Calculator knows his math!  
Just kidding, I promised this would be pretty easy ;)

Now we'll do some comparisons, simple stuff.

<FreeQuestion
  question="Write any number greater than 200."
  code="200 < ?"
  correct="Correct!"
/>

<FreeQuestion
  question="Okay... Now a number smaller than 200."
  code="200 > ?"
  correct="Perfect!"
/>

<FreeQuestion
  question="Now one that's smaller or equal than 0."
  code="0 >= ?"
  correct="Good answer!"
/>

<FreeQuestion
  question="And finally one that's greater or equal than 0."
  code="0 <= ?"
  correct="Fantastic!"
/>

:::tip[Exercise]
See what we're doing here?  
Try rewriting the code of the exercises above, exactly how the question is formulated.

For instance, for the first question, instead of saying `200 is smaller than ?`, say `? is greater than 200`.
Remember to fill in the `?` in your final submission.

<FreeQuestion
  question="Write any number greater than 200."
  correct="Correct!"
/>

<FreeQuestion
  question="Okay... Now a number smaller than 200."
  correct="Perfect!"
/>

<FreeQuestion
  question="Now one that's smaller or equal than 0."
  correct="Good answer!"
/>

<FreeQuestion
  question="And finally one that's greater or equal than 0."
  correct="Fantastic!"
/>

Excellent!  
Now please sign here, and you'll be ready to take your first quest.

<QuestionCard>
  <CodeBlock
    client:only
    code={'let name = "?";'}
    setup={
      '__VALUE__; if name == "?" { println!("hint: just replace ? with your name!") } else { println!("{name}, welcome to the Adventurer\'s Guild!") }'
    }
  />
</QuestionCard>
