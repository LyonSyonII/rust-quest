First of all, thank you for reading Rust Quest!

This book is built accounting for people with zero experience about Rust or programming in general, so don't be scared, I'm sure you'll leave having learned something!

Usually, Rust is viewed as a language with a very steep learning curve, and not recommended as a first language.  
Well, my mission here is to demonstrate the opposite!

I believe that Rust is a very strict but thorough teacher, that will make sure you understand what your code does before even letting you execute it.  
This may seem undesirable at first, "let me run my program!" I hear a lot of you saying.  
But the truth is that this strictness will make you a better programmer, a programmer that writes code that "works the first time".

This is a somewhat special book, as it's structured in 'Quests', where each one will teach you about a specific topic on programming.  
Each 'Quest' will have a code snippet, and you'll need to modify it in some way to complete it.

Try running the following snippet (click the "Run" button at the right or "Shift + Enter" on your keyboard):

<CodeBlock client:only code={'println!("Hello World!")'} />

:::tip[Exercise]
Well... Your name isn't _World_, right?  
Try changing the line to say `Hello {YourName}!` instead.  
e.g. `"Hello Liam!"`
