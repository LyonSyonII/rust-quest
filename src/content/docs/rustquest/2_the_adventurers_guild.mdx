Morning adventurer!
I see you're new on this town, welcome to Newlia, where new heroes are born!

Oh, you want to register as a new adventurer? And you want to choose the "Programmer" class?
Good choice! Programmers are a very versatile class, give them enough time and they can do anything!

This class requires a small test, to ensure that you have the minimum problem solving skills. Don't worry, it'll be a moment.
Please, fill up the gaps in the following statements, replace "?" with the correct answer.

What's five plus five?

```rust,editable
#assert!(
5 + 5 == ?
#)
#println!("5 + 5 == 10, good job!")
```

Well done! Let's continue.

What's negative one minus one?

```rust,editable
#assert!(
-1 - 1 == ?
#)
#println!("That's right, -2! I see you aren't fooled easily")
```

All right, let's up the challenge a bit.

What's the number that multiplied by two equals sixteen divided by four?

```rust,editable
#assert!(
16 / 4 == 2 * ?
#)
#println!("You now know how to make the computer do basic calculations for you, good job!")
```

Well well, Mr. Calculator knows his math! Just joking, I told you it would be pretty easy ;)

Now we'll do some comparisons, simple stuff.

Write any number higher than 200.

```rust,editable
#assert!(
200 < ?
#)
```

Okay... Now a number smaller than 200.

```rust,editable
#assert!(
200 > ?
#)
```

Now one that's smaller or equal than 0.

```rust,editable
#assert!(
0 >= ?
#)
```

And finally one that's greater or equal than 0.

```rust,editable
#assert!(
0 <= ?
#)
```

> See what we're doing here?
> Try writing the examples above exactly how the question is formulated.
> For example, the first one is currently saying "two hundred is smaller than ?" instead of "? is greater than two hundred".

Excellent!
Now please sign here, and you'll be ready to take your first quest.

```rust,editable
let name = "?";
#if name == "?" { println!("hint: just replace '?' with your name!") }
#else { println!("Welcome {name} to the Adventurer's Guild!") }
```
