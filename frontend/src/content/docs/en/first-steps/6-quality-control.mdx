After the intense mission from yesterday, you're feeling a bit worn out, so you decide to take it easy and opt for something less demanding.

<Guild eager>
Ah, looking for a lighter task, are we? Let me see...
</Guild>

The receptionist shuffles through a stack of papers.

<Guild eager>
Here, this one should be a breeze.  
It's a request to add some quality control directives to a few Magic Boxes‚Ñ¢.  
</Guild>

Alright, let's see what this is about.

A short walk later, you arrive at the address given to you.  
It's a cozy little shop, and the first thing you notice is a large, striking silhouette of a fish engraved on the door.

Just as you raise your hand to knock, the door swings open, revealing a cheerful girl with a big smile.

<Fish eager>
Welcome adventurer, I've been waiting for you!  
Those magic boxes aren't going to get working themselves!
</Fish>

Before you can even respond, she grabs your hand and eagerly pulls you into the shop.

<Fish>
Look, here they are!
</Fish>

She gestures toward the counter.

At first it seems like an ordinary counter, but as you look closer, you notice the familiar displays of the Magic Boxes‚Ñ¢ integrated into its surface.

<Fish>
I use these to keep the fish cold so it doesn't spoil.  

They were working just fine until a few days ago, but now the temperature's going haywire, 
seems like the programming's broken somehow.

Could you take a look and see what's wrong?
</Fish>

You answer affirmatively and procede to investigate the issue.  

First of all, you look at the instructions left from the previous programmer:

<Card background="var(--color-paper)" border={false} rounded>
#### Temperature Regulating Magic Boxes‚Ñ¢
This program helps regulate the boxes' temperature to the desired range by adjusting the target depending on the boxes' current temperature.  
The boxes will try to match this temperature until it changes.

If the temperature is too low, the target will be raised, and if too high lowered.  
This ensures the actual temperature is always between the minimum and the maximum.

##### 1. Available values

| Value      | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MIN_TEMP` | Constant that describes the **minimum temperature** the fish can be at |
| `MAX_TEMP` | Constant that describes the **maximum temperature** the fish can be at |
| `target`   | Variable that represents the boxes' **target temperature**             |
| `temp`     | Variable that represents the boxes' **current temperature**            |

  <Fish>
  Thank you, the fish won't spoil anymore!

  I know this was supposed to be all but... Could you help me set up some more directives?  
  I'd really apreciate having it done by today instead of waiting for another programmer to show up.
  </Fish>

  The task was easy, and you don't have a lot to do for today.  
  Why not, let's help her!
  
  <Fish>
  Great üòÅ!
  
  See, the fisherman brings me different kinds of fish everyday, and hand-writing new labels is a bit wasteful.  
  Could you program the boxes to recognize each species and set the price accordingly?  
  
  It should follow this table:
| Name    | Price |
| :------ | :---- |
| salmon  | 25.0  |
| seabass | 28.5  |
| tuna    | 28.0  |
| trout   | 10.0  |
  </Fish>
