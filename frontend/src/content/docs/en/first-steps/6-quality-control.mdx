After the intense mission from yesterday, you're feeling a bit worn out, so you decide to take it easy and opt for something less demanding.

<Guild>
Ah, looking for a lighter task, are we? Let me see...
</Guild>

The receptionist shuffles through a stack of papers.

<Guild>
Here, this one should be a breeze.  
It's a request to add some quality control directives to a few Magic Boxes™.  
</Guild>

Alright, let's see what this is about.

A short walk later, you arrive at the address given to you.  
It's a cozy little shop, and the first thing you notice is a large, striking silhouette of a fish engraved on the door.

Just as you raise your hand to knock, the door swings open, revealing a cheerful girl with a big smile.

<Fish>
Welcome adventurer, I've been waiting for you!  
Those magic boxes aren't going to get working themselves!
</Fish>

Before you can even respond, she grabs your hand and eagerly pulls you into the shop.

<Fish>
Look, here they are!
</Fish>

She gestures toward the counter.

At first, it seems like an ordinary counter, but as you look closer, you notice the familiar displays of the Magic Boxes™ integrated into its surface.

<Fish>
I use these to keep the fish cold so it doesn't spoil.  

They were working just fine until a few days ago, but now the temperature's going haywire, 
seems like the programming's broken somehow.

Could you take a look and see what's wrong?
</Fish>

You XXX affirmatively and procede to investigate the issue.
