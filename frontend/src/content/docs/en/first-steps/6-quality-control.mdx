After the intense mission from yesterday, you're feeling a bit worn out, so you decide to take it easy and opt for something less demanding.

<Guild>
Ah, looking for a lighter task, are we? Let me see...
</Guild>

The receptionist shuffles through a stack of papers.

<Guild>
Here, this one should be a breeze.  
It's a request to add some quality control directives to a few Magic Boxes™.  
</Guild>

Alright, let's see what this is about.

A short walk later, you arrive at the address given to you.  
It's a cozy little shop, and the first thing you notice is a large, striking silhouette of a fish engraved on the door.

Just as you raise your hand to knock, the door swings open, revealing a cheerful girl with a big smile.

<Fish>
Welcome adventurer, I've been waiting for you!  
Those magic boxes aren't going to get working themselves!
</Fish>

Before you can even respond, she grabs your hand and eagerly pulls you into the shop.

<Fish>
Look, here they are!
</Fish>

She gestures toward the counter.

At first, it seems like an ordinary counter, but as you look closer, you notice the familiar displays of the Magic Boxes™ integrated into its surface.

<Fish>
I use these to keep the fish cold so it doesn't spoil.  

They were working just fine until a few days ago, but now the temperature's going haywire, 
seems like the programming's broken somehow.

Could you take a look and see what's wrong?
</Fish>

You answer affirmatively and procede to investigate the issue.  

First of all, you look at the instructions left from the previous programmer:

<QuestionCard background="var(--color-paper)" border={false} rounded>
#### Temperature Regulating Magic Boxes™
This program helps regulate the boxes' temperature to the desired range by adjusting the target depending on the current temperature.  
The boxes will try to match this temperature until it changes.

If the temperature is too low, the target will be raised, and if too high lowered.  
This ensures the actual temperature is always between the minimum and the maximum.

##### 1. Available values

| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MIN_TEMP` | Constant that describes the **minimum temperature** the fish can be at |
| `MAX_TEMP` | Constant that describes the **maximum temperature** the fish can be at |
| `target`   | Variable that represents the boxes' **target temperature**             |
