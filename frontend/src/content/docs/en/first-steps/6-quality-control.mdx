Being pretty exhausted from yesterday's mission, you decide to take it easy and get a less demanding one.

<Guild>
Oh, you want an easier mission?  
Let me see...  

Here, I think this is a good one!  
It's a petition to add quality control directives to some Magic Boxesâ„¢.  
</Guild>

Well then, let's see what this is about.

After a bit of walking, you get to the address you were provided.  
It's a small but well-mantained shop, with a big fish silhouette engraved in the door.

Before you have time to knock, the door opens and reveals a smiling girl.

<Fish>
Welcome adventurer!  
I've been waiting, those boxes won't get ready on their own!
</Fish>

Leaving no time for you to reply, she takes your hand and pulls you inside the shop.
