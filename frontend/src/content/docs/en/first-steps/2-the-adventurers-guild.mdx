Good morning, welcome to Newlia, where new heroes are born!

Are you here to register as an adventurer? And you want to choose the "Programmer" class?
Great choice! Programmers are a versatile class, give them enough time and they can do anything!

**This class requires a small test**, We're going to prove you have the minimum problem-solving skills.  
It'll take just a moment.

Please, **fill in the blanks** in the following statements, **replacing `?`** with the correct answer.

  :::tip[Exercise]
  See what we're doing here?  
  **Try rewriting the code of the exercises** above, **exactly how the question is formulated**.
  
  For instance, for the first question, **instead of saying `200 is smaller than ?`, say `? is greater than 200`**.  
  Remember to fill in the `?` in your final submission.
  
  <CodeQuestion
    id="2-4"
    question="Write any number greater than 200."
    code=""
    showLineNumbers={false}
