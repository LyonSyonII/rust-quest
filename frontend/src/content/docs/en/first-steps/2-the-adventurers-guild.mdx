Good morning, welcome to Newlia, where new heroes are born!

Are you here to register as an adventurer? And you want to choose the "Programmer" class?  
Great choice! Programmers are a versatile class, give them enough time and they can do anything!

This class requires a small test, to make sure you have the minimum problem-solving skills.  
It'll take just a moment.

Please, fill in the blanks in the following statements, replacing **`?`** with the correct answer.

  Well done! Let's continue.

  All right, let's up the challenge a bit.

  <SimpleQuestion
    question="What's the number that multiplied by two equals sixteen divided by four?"
    code="16 / 4 == 2 * ?"
    answer="2"
    correct="Perfect! Now you know how to make the computer do basic calculations for you, well done!"

  Well, well, Mx. Calculator knows their math!  
  Just kidding, I promised this would be pretty easy ðŸ˜‰.
  
  Now we'll do some comparisons, simple stuff.

  <FreeQuestion
    question="Write any number greater than 200."
    code="200 < ?"
    correct="Correct!"

  <FreeQuestion
    question="Okay... Now a number smaller than 200."
    code="200 > ?"
    correct="Perfect!"

<Checkpoint id="2-5">
  <FreeQuestion
    question="Now one that's smaller or equal than 0."
    code="0 >= ?"
    correct="Good answer!"

<Checkpoint id="2-6">
  <FreeQuestion
    question="And finally one that's greater or equal than 0."
    code="0 <= ?"

  :::tip[Exercise]
  See what we're doing here?  
  Try rewriting the code of the exercises above, exactly how the question is formulated.
  
  For instance, for the first question, instead of saying `200 is smaller than ?`, say `? is greater than 200`.  
  Remember to fill in the `?` in your final submission.
  
  <FreeQuestion
    question="Write any number greater than 200."
    correct="Correct!"
  />

  <FreeQuestion
    question="Okay... Now a number smaller than 200."
    correct="Perfect!"
  />
  
  <FreeQuestion
    question="Now one that's smaller or equal than 0."
    correct="Good answer!"
  />
  
  <FreeQuestion
    question="And finally one that's greater or equal than 0."
    correct="Fantastic!"
