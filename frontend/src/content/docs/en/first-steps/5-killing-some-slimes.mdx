After long days of paperwork and chores, you've finally received your first real quest!  
You can't contain your excitement and quickly open the letter:

Okay... Time to read those instructions.  
Let's see.

<QuestionCard background="var(--color-paper)" border={false} rounded>
#### Summoned Robot Instructions
Congratulations on acquiring our Monster-Killing Robot!  
This manual provides essential instructions to ensure optimal performance and safety.

##### 1. Available functions
The robot initialy has 4 possible functions:

| Action     | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `up();`    | Move the robot up one space    |
| `down();`  | Move the robot down one space  |
| `left();`  | Move the robot left one space  |
| `right();` | Move the robot right one space |

More functions will be unlocked once enough monsters are defeated.

##### 2. Usage
To kill a monster, just move the robot where it is and the machine will do the rest.

To ensure a 100% success rate, multiple simulations will run before executing your program.  
**This means that your code must be able to solve ALL the simulations at the same time.**

##### 3. Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Adhere to local laws and regulations governing the use of monster-killing robots.
- Exercise ethical judgement to ensure the safety of bystanders and property.

If you have any issue, don't hesitate to reach out to our customer support for further assistance.
We wish you a happy monster extermination!

Oopsâ€”while you were reading, one of these gelatinous things came up to you.

<Hint>
Remember the instructions:
- `up();`
- `down();`
- `left();`
- `right();`

Don't forget the semicolon at the end of each function!

<Checkpoint id="5-2-robot">

Once the simulation is complete, the robot moves swiftly and punches the slime to death, well done!.

But the machine's fighting isn't specially stealthy, causing it to alert a nearby monster.

  question="Finish another one!"

</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint id="5-3-robot">

The robot is trying its best to follow your instructions, but the slime is surprisingly quick and manages to dodge every blow.

It seems like one simulation isn't enough, let's try with two!

<Hint>
Each "simulation" is represented by a different board.  
Your code will need to solve all of them to be considered correct.

Try solving the first simulation and see what happens.

This time, the monster tries to dodge like before, but the machine predicts the movement and blows it up with a very cool rocket fist.

#### New functions unlocked
Two new functions have been unlocked:

| Action             | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `is_slime_left()`  | Returns `true` if a slime is located at the *left* of the robot.<br/>Works even if the slime is not adjacent.  |
| `is_slime_right()` | Returns `true` if a slime is located at the *right* of the robot.<br/>Works even if the slime is not adjacent. |                                                                                    

:::tip[Tip]
If a function name is too long, you can abreviate it to only the initials.  
For example, `is_slime_left()` can be called as `isl()`.

*This is only for this book, don't try doing it in real code!*

Great, new instructions!  
But why would these unlock now?  

<b style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">WARNING WARNING, THE ROBOT IS OVERHEATED, PLEASE REDUCE THE SIMULATION STEPS TO A MINIMUM</b>

...Well, here's the answer.  
Maybe we can use these to avoid unnecessary steps?

<Hint>
See the "Minimum Steps" message below every simulation?  
This means that you have to solve it in that amount of steps.

To do it, you need to use the newly unlocked functions to check if there's a slime to the left or right of the robot.  
Try replacing the `?` with one of them and see what happens!

Good! Work smarter, not harder. ðŸ˜‰

Unaware of your power, more slimes come to you.

<Hint>
If you're receiving the "You don't need more than two instructions" message, it means that the problem can be solved with a more general approach.  

Read your code and see if you can simplify it.  
For example, the following snippet:
```rust
if is_slime_left() {
  down(); // repeated
  left();
}
if is_slime_right() {
  down();  // repeated
  right();
}
```
Can be simplified to:
```rust
down(); // no longer repeated
if is_slime_left() {
  left();
}
if is_slime_right() {
  right();
}
```

<Checkpoint id="5-6-robot">
:::note[Why only 2 instructions in each condition?]
In this exercise, you've been forced to write only two instructions in each `if` statement. 

Why? Well, code repetition should be avoided, "be as lazy as possible", they say.  
Imagine that instead of only `up()`, the extra code was 20 lines long. It would be harder to manage, right?

Try to always write simpler code, it will pay off.
:::

Well done, all slimes will tremble in fear when they hear your name!  

...Or at least most of them, because the ones in front of you seem completely unfazed with your killing.  
Let's teach them a lesson!

<Hint>
If you're in doubt, try solving it without accounting for the minimum steps and then think of what you can do to reduce them.

A good way to know when to use conditionals is to solve the problem aloud:  
*if the slime is on the left of the robot, go there, if not...*

You even handled a different number of steps for simulation, excellent job!  

But then you hear a characteristic _squish_, you look behind and there they areâ€”it's an ambush!  
<b style="color: red; text-decoration: underline">WARNING WARNING, IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION FOUND, USE OF `else` IS REQUIRED</b>  

Okay, I know `if`, but... What's this `else`?
<Hint>
Think of `else` as a default path if none of the above worked.

What will happen if the slime isn't at the left of the robot when the `if is_slime_left()` condition is reached?
</Hint>
<RobotGame
id="5-8-robot"
question="Solve this, or else..."
code={`
up();
if is_slime_left() {
  
} else {
  
}
`}
/>
</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint id="5-8-robot">
:::note[Why the else?]
In this case the normal line of thought would be to use a `is_slime_up()` function, but it isn't available yet!

For this reason, we can use `else` to signify a case where none of our previous conditions is met.
:::

No slimes in sight, at last, your job is done.

Or so you thought, because to your horror three slimes fall from the sky, prepared for the final fight.  

> threeslimesfight.png

You're almost there. Hang on!

<Hint>
`else if` is a special case of `else` that allows you to check for another condition.

It's especially useful because it only runs if the previous `if` or `else if` didn't.
</Hint>

<RobotGame
id="5-9-robot"
question="The final challenge!"
code={`
up();
if ? {
  
} else if ? {
  
} else {
  
}
`}
/>
</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint id="5-9-robot">
:::note[A bit more on conditions]
As you've probably seen, `else` and `else if` are powerful because they allow you to chain multiple conditions, ensuring that the previous ones are `false`.

For example, when `else` is reached, it means that there isn't a slime either to the left or to the right of the robot.

If we had used `if` instead, we would have had to check for both conditions again, which is redundant.
:::
You did it! You saved the world from the slime invasion!

Well, maybe it wasn't that dramatic, but you did a great job.

This was a long one though, so let's take a break and celebrate your victory!
