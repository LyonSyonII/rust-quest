After long days of paperwork and chores, you've finally recieved your first real quest!
You can't contain the excitement and quickly open the letter:

Okay... Time to read those instructions.  
Let's see.

#### Summoned Robot Instructions
Congratulations on acquiring our Monster-Killing Robot!  
This manual provides essential instructions to ensure optimal performance and safety.

##### 1. Available functions
The robot initialy has 4 possible functions:

| Action     | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `up();`    | Move the robot up one space    |
| `down();`  | Move the robot down one space  |
| `left();`  | Move the robot left one space  |
| `right();` | Move the robot right one space |

More functions will be unlocked once enough monsters are defeated.

##### 2. Usage
To kill a monster, just move the robot where it is and the machine will do the rest.

To ensure 100% success rate, multiple simulations will run before executing your program.  
**This means that your code must be able to solve ALL the simulations.**

##### 3. Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Adhere to local laws and regulations governing the use of monster-killing robots.
- Exercise ethical judgement to ensure the safety of bystanders and property.

If you have any issue, don't hesitate to reach out to our customer support for further assistance.
We wish you a happy monster extermination!
</QuestionCard>

<Hint>
Remember the instructions:
- `up();`
- `down();`
- `left();`
- `right();`

Don't forget the semicolon at the end of each function!

Once the simulation is complete, the robot swiftly starts moving and punches the slime to death.

One down, many more to go!

Another slime bites the dust!

Now there's two simulations?  
No problem, you can handle this!

<Hint>
Each "simulation" is represented by a different board.  
Your code will need to solve all of them to be considered correct.

Try solving the first simulation and see what happens.

Seems like you're getting the hang of it!

#### New functions unlocked!
Two new functions have been unlocked:

| Action              | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `is_slime_left()`  | Returns `true` if a slime is located at the *left* of the robot.{/* <br/>Works even if the slime is not adjacent.  */}|
| `is_slime_right()` | Returns `true` if a slime is located at the *right* of the robot.{/* <br/>Works even if the slime is not adjacent. */}                                                                                    |

:::tip[Tip]
If a function name is too long, you can abreviate it to only the initials.  
For example, `is_slime_left()` can be called as `isl()`.

This is only for this book, don't try doing it in real code!

</QuestionCard>

<Hint>
See the "Minimum Steps" message below every simulation?  
This means that you have to solve it in that amount of steps.

To do it, you need to use the newly unlocked functions to check if there's a slime to the left or right of the robot.  
Try replacing the `?` with one of them and see what happens!
