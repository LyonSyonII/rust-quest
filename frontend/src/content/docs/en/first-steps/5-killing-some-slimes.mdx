After long days of paperwork and chores, you've finally recieved your first real quest!
You can't contain the excitement and quickly open the letter:

export const quest = `
Greetings adventurer!
We hope you're ready for some fun, because this will be your first hunt quest!

As you're still a rookie, your mission will be to kill some slimes and collect their blobs, which are quite valued in alchemy.

Because you're a Programmer, you won't be killing them yourself.
Instead, with this letter comes the spell "summon robot", which will summon a companion that you'll have to command.

Read the instructions before using it!
Good luck!
