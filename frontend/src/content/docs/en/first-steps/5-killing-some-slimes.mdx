### Summoned Robot Instructions
Congratulations on acquiring our Monster-Killing Robot!  
This manual provides essential instructions to ensure optimal performance and safety.

#### 1. Available functions
The robot initialy has 4 possible functions:

| Action     | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `up();`    | Move the robot up one space    |
| `down();`  | Move the robot down one space  |
| `left();`  | Move the robot left one space  |
| `right();` | Move the robot right one space |

More functions will be unlocked once enough monsters are defeated.

#### 2. Usage
To kill a monster, just move the robot where it is and the machine will do the rest.

To ensure 100% success rate, multiple simulations will run before executing your program.  
**This means that your code must be able to solve ALL the simulations.**

#### 3. Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Adhere to local laws and regulations governing the use of monster-killing robots.
- Exercise ethical judgement to ensure the safety of bystanders and property.

If you have any issue, don't hesitate to reach out to our customer support for further assistance.
We wish you a happy monster extermination!
