:::danger[Page in testing phase]
This page should be finished, but there might be some bugs or things that are hard to understand.  
Proceed with caution!
:::

:::caution[Data collection?]
**DATA WILL NOT BE COLLECTED** in any way, it's just for the exercise.  
If you're worried about it, use dummy values that don't match your real data.
:::

You wake up, eat a nutritious breakfast, and head to the guild to get your next mission.

<Guild>
Morning! Did you sleep well?

I'm sorry, but now that you've completed your first quest, you need to officially register, which means... More paperwork!

Please fill in the remaining information in the blanks provided:
</Guild>

<CodeQuestion 
  id="4-1"
  question="Fill in your name and age:"
/>
:::note[Why is age mutable?]
Well, you are getting older, right?  

What you need to understand about `mut` is that it also has a semantic meaning.  
If a variable has it, it means it WILL change, if not (or you're not sure), make it immutable, you can always add the `mut` later.
:::

<Checkpoint id="4-1">
<Guild>
Thought that was it? We're just getting started!
</Guild>

<CodeQuestion 
  id="4-2"
  question="Enter your height (meters), weight (kilograms) and current money:"
/>
</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint id="4-2">
:::note[Numbers]
In the last two exercises, there were two types of numbers.  
First, `age`, which is an integer number (without a decimal point), and second, `money`, which is a decimal number.  

In Rust, these numbers are completely different and cannot be mixed in any way.  
For example, if you try to do `2 + 1.5`, you will get an error saying that you can't add an integer and a decimal.

You don't need to worry about this at the moment, but keep it in mind.
:::
<Guild>
Why do we need your weight?  
We've had some problems with traps before, you know, the "step on a pressure plate and a giant boulder crushes you" ones...  

*Ahem*, shall we continue?
</Guild>
<CodeQuestion 
  id="4-3"
  question="Enter your initials and your favourite cardinal point (N / S / E / W):"
/>
</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint id="4-3">
:::note[Have you noticed?]
Whenever we needed to write text with more than one character, we used double quotes `"`, and when it was only one, we used single quotes `'`.

This is because, again, Rust distinguishes between the two.  
Double quotes `"` declare a `string`, while single quotes `'` declare a `char`.

I know, that's a lot of concepts, but don't worry, that's all you need to know for now.
:::
<Guild>
Huh? Asking for a favorite cardinal direction is weird?  
Well... I can't really argue with that.

Unfortunately, there's only one form left, let's get to it!
</Guild>
<CodeQuestion 
  id="4-4"
  question="Answer with true or false to the following questions:"
/>
</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint id="4-4">
:::note[Why I don't need to use quotes this time?]
While text is written in double quotes, `true` and `false` are special values that aren't considered text.  
Instead, they're called `booleans`, and can **only** be either `true` or `false`.  

The name comes from 'George Boole', the mathematician who invented them.

Remember the "Adventurer's Guild" chapter? We were doing Boolean logic back then.  
When you evaluate an expression like `200 < 1000`, it returns a boolean value (in this case `true`), because the expression can only be `true` or `false`.
:::
<Guild>
And... We're done!  

I have to finish your registration, so I don't think I'll be able to give you a quest for today.  
Please come back tomorrow.

See you later!
</Guild>

Finally, the paperwork is over!  
You're exhausted after filling out all those forms, so you return to the inn and fall right into bed.
