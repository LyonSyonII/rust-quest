<WIP />

You wake up, eat a nutritious breakfast, and head to the guild to receive your next mission.

<Guild>
Morning! Did you sleep well?

I'm sorry, but now that you've completed your first mission, you need to officially register, which means... More paperwork!

Please fill in the remaining information in the blanks provided:

:::caution[Data collection?]
**DATA WILL NOT BE COLLECTED** in any way, it's just an exercise.  
If you're worried about it, use dummy values that don't match your real data.

:::note[Why is age mutable?]
Well, you'll get older, right?  

What you need to understand about `mut` is that it also has a semantic meaning.  
If a variable has it, it means it WILL change, if not (or you're unsure), make it immutable, you can always add the `mut` later.
