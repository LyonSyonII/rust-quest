Welcome to Rust Quest, the interactive book for learning programming from scratch!  

Here you'll acquire the ability to think like a programmer, and the skills to translate these thoughts into actual programs.  

So... Why Rust? Isn't it seen as a very difficult language and usually not recommended for beginners?  
Well, my goal is to prove that not only it can be your first programming language, but that it's one of the best choices.

This is a strong opinion to have, but hopefully my reasoning will become clear as you read.  

Also, dont be afraid!  
Once you learn one language well, transitioning into others will be much easier.  
Programming isn't about the language, it's about the way you reason and apply what you know.

Now, what makes this book special?  

[The official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to learn Rust.  
The problem is that is assumes that you know at least another language, so it's less than ideal for starting out.

This book is meant to fill this gap, to provide a way to learn Rust from zero, in a fun and fulfilling way. 

To achieve this objective, I've divided core concepts into "Quests".  
Each quest provides small programming exercises that you'll need to solve to continue.

It is possible that sometimes you won't understand what's going on, and that's okay!  
In my experience, the best way to learn something is to battle with it, and find out the answers by yourself.

If you find yourself stuck, you can always click on the "Hint" button (the light bulb icon) to get a little help.

<Hint visible="true">
  I'm a hint ðŸ’¡  
  Click me when you are stuck with a problem, but try solving it for yourself first!
</Hint>

Now, try running the following snippet (click the <RunButton style="display:inline;margin-bottom:-6px"/> button on the right or press `Ctrl + â†µ` on your keyboard while editing):

export const errorMsg =
`Woops, something went wrong and the code does not compile!
If you've mistakenly messed up the code, click the "Reset" button to return it back to its original state.`;

<CodeQuestion
  showLineNumbers={false}
  errorMsg={errorMsg}
  id="1-1"
/>

<Checkpoint id="1-1">
:::tip[Exercise]
Well... Your name isn't _World_, right?  
**Try changing the line to say `Hello {your_name}!`** instead.  
For example: `"Hello Ferris!"`.

You just made the computer talk directly to you. Isn't it cool?
