Thank you for reading Rust Quest!  
This book is designed for people with zero experience in Rust or programming in general, so don't worry, I'm sure you'll leave having learned something!

Usually, Rust is seen as a difficult language to learn, and is not recommended as a first language.  
Well, my goal is to prove otherwise!

I believe Rust is a very strict but thorough teacher, that makes sure you understand your code before letting you run it.  
Some may find this unappealing at first: "Let me run my program!"  
However, this strictness will make you a better programmer, one that writes code that "works the first time".

What makes this book unique is that it's organized into 'Quests'.  
Each quest provides a programming lesson and includes snippets of code that you'll need to write modify in order to complete it.

It is possible that sometimes you won't understand what's going on, and that's okay!

Most exercises follow the "learn by doing" approach, and will expect you to find the solution on your own, even if you do not fully understand.  
If you find yourself stuck, you can always click on the "Hint" button (the light bulb icon) to get a little help.

Try running the following snippet (click the "Run" button on the right or press `â‡§ + â†µ` on your keyboard while editing):

export const errorMsg =
`Woops, something went wrong and the code does not compile!
If you've mistakenly messed up the code, click the "Reset" button to return it back to its original state.`

<Hint>
  I'm a hint ðŸ’¡  
  Click me when you are stuck with a problem, but try solving it for yourself first!

<CodeQuestion 
  code={'println!("Hello World!")'}
  showLineNumbers={false}
  errorMsg={errorMsg}
  id="1-1"
/>

<Checkpoint id="1-1">
:::tip[Exercise]
Well... Your name isn't _World_, right?  
Try changing the line to say `Hello {YourName}!` instead.  
e.g. `"Hello Liam!"`.
