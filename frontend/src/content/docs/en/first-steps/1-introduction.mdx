Rust Quest is a book for learning programming from scratch, without any previous experience.  

Then... Why Rust? Isn't it seen as a very difficult language and usually not recommended for beginners?  
Well, my goal is to prove that not only can it be your first programming language, but that it's one of the best choices.

This is a strong opinion to have, but hopefully my reasoning will become clear as you read.  

Now, what makes this book special?  

[The official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to learn Rust.  
The problem is that is assumes that you know at least another language, so it's less than ideal for starting out.

This book is meant to fill this gap, to provide a way to learn Rust from zero, in a fun and fullfilling way. 

To achieve this objective, I've divided core concepts into "Quests".  
Each quest provides small programming exercises that you'll need to solve to continue.

It is possible that sometimes you won't understand what's going on, and that's okay!  
In my experience, the best way to learn something is to battle with it, and find out the answers by yourself.

If you find yourself stuck, you can always click on the "Hint" button (the light bulb icon) to get a little help.

<Hint visible="true">
  I'm a hint ðŸ’¡  
  Click me when you are stuck with a problem, but try solving it for yourself first!
</Hint>

Now, try running the following snippet (click the <Run/> button on the right or press `Ctrl + â†µ` on your keyboard while editing):












{/* Thank you for reading Rust Quest!  
This book is designed for people with zero experience in Rust or programming in general, so don't worry, I'm sure you'll leave having learned something!

Usually, Rust is seen as a difficult language to learn, and is not recommended as a first language.  
Well, my goal is to prove otherwise!

I believe Rust is a very strict but thorough teacher, that makes sure you understand your code before letting you run it.  
Some may find this unappealing at first: "Let me run my program!"  
However, this strictness will make you a better programmer, one that writes code that "works the first time".

What makes this book unique is that it's organized into 'Quests'.  
Each quest provides a programming lesson and includes snippets of code that you'll need to write modify in order to complete it.

It is possible that sometimes you won't understand what's going on, and that's okay!

Most exercises follow the "learn by doing" approach, and will expect you to find the solution on your own, even if you do not fully grasp all the concepts.  
If you find yourself stuck, you can always click on the "Hint" button (the light bulb icon) to get a little help.
