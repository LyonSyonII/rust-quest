## Why Rust?

I believe that Rust is a very strict and thorough teacher, that will make sure you understand what your code does before even letting you execute it.  
This may seem undesirable at first, but the truth is that this strictness will make you a better programmer, a programmer that writes code that "works the first time".

I've also chosen Rust because it's conceived as a language with a very steep learning curve, and not recommended as a first language.  
Well, my mission here is to demonstrate the opposite!

The book is still in a very early stage of development, and translations aren't supported yet.    
I'd really apreciate any proofreading though!
